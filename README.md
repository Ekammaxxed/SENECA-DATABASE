# SENECA-DATABASE

In this assignment, you will design an implement a database for the BSA program. This database will store information about courses in the program. Samples of course outlines are attached (Table 1 samples).
Some information to help you design the database follows:
1-	Each course is identified by a course code (for example BTD210).
2-	Each course has one or more course learning outcomes (CLOs).
3-	Each course can meet one or more of the 8 program learning outcomes (PLOs). 
4-	One or more of the 12 engineering graduate attributes (GAs) are taught in each course. 
5-	Each course can have zero to many pre-requisites, which must be courses offered in previous semesters. 
6-	Each course can have zero to many textbooks. It is possible to have the same textbook in multiple courses.
7-	Each course is developed by one of the Professors. For example:
8-	Each academic term, e.g., Fall 2024 (code: 2247) zero to many of the program courses are offered, possibly in multiple sections. For example, BTD210NAA_2247 and BTD210NCC_2247 are two sections of the BTD210 course offered in Fall 2024. 
9-	Each course section (e.g. BTD210NAA_2247) can have one or more professors. Each professor can teach zero to many course sections in each academic term. For example, these courses were offered:
